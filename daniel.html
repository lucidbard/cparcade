                                escaping one's original nature (as embodied and fulfilled by Holly in Truman Capote’s "Breakfast at Tiffany's"), here retain a memory of their original narrative while torn from it in a digital reworking. A bit of dialogue
                                and the song, sung by Audrey Hepburn in the 1961 movie based on the novella, are re-recorded backwards with minimal processing. By this simple process, the song makes a complete transformation: with its own distinct melody,
                                arrangement, language and meaning - a current pulling forward (now dragging backward) as the piece ends with Holly (or Lula Mae) not so much singing as swallowing her own words.</h5>

                                hermetic and intelligible through their collective role making up the whole and through their familiarity: breath, sighs, sounds with a particular cadence. It is particularly effective I believe for the themes and the sounds
                                in the piece to be expressed by a woman. The interrupted, cut short, detached bits of the stories of the novella and film and song in some sense reflect a detachment of women's voices and the modes of expression traditionally
                                expected or not expected of them – to varying degrees they were not expected to have anything intelligible or of import to say, believed not to have the same capacity to contribute to discourse, literature or political
                                speech as men, women's voices were heard in hushed tones (like the lull of lullabies), in sighs and hums and moans, gasping or singing, breath for comfort. The bits of words in the piece are moving for what they imply and
                                for their familiarity - in these ways, in spite of and through their electronic obliterations, the words and their expressions are clear. </h5>
